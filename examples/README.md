## fizzpy Examples

Most of the contents of this library are jupyter notebook examples. If you're into
installing things globally just make sure that you install the other library dependencies
as well. If you like to keep your environments contained, a requirements file is included 
in the root of this directory that can be used with conda to build an environment where
everything more or less runs without complaining.

If you encounter any issues using these examples feel free to open an issue on the repo. 
Please include as much information about your environment configuration as possible and 
the team will address it as soon as possible.
