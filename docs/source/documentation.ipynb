    "\n",
    "With Tensorflow, formalize how to work with what's described at the end of <i>Techniques in Fractal Geometry</i> by Kenneth Falconer: \"there are certain circumstances when it is appropriate to seek solutions of a 'differential equation' defined on a set that is itself fractal, <b>for example when modelling conduction of</b> heat or <b>electricity through a highly porous material</b>.\"  \n",

    "Helper Functions:   \n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "* Helper functions are used to make the notebook code less verbose, they will appear in Helper.py  \n",
    "* The goal of the helper functions is to abstract the user away from as much of the nut and bolts of the codey coding as possible in order to allow more focus on manipulation and experimentation with the mathematical models under study\n",

    "---------------------\n",
    "* All of this stuff is built inside a Conda environment, I will do my best to keep requirements updated so that these notebooks are more or less portable across platforms and results displayed in the notebooks are reproducable "
