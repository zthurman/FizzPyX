======

An interdisciplinary library of mathematical models for Fizzicks, Math, Biology and Engineering
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goals
^^^^^
* Reduce code overhead for user interaction with mathematical models
* Allow users to spend less time figuring out how to formulate the code and more time exploring model behavior
* Expose tools that assist with exploring model solutions
