Generalized Differential Equation Solver Application

This is a working program. Bringing an ODE solver library to life.

Physics is the language of the universe expressed in the form of mathematics. Explore it and discover the elegance and beauty underlying that which we experience every day as reality.

Goal
=============

The goal of developing this application is to provide an open source reference for students of science and mathematics to get a handle on object oriented programming and how it can be
used to make studying mathematical models easier. The other plus is that it will provide a programming background for those science and mathematics students willing to dive in. In the
age of computers this will only increase the value of the scientists skillset in the workplace as well as contribute to a sense of satisfaction.
