Generalized Differential Equation Solver

This is a functioning cross platform desktop application. Bringing an ODE solver to life.

Physics is the language of the universe expressed in the form of mathematics. Explore it and discover the elegance and beauty underlying that which we experience every day as reality.

Goal
=============

The goal of developing this application is to provide an open source reference for students of science and mathematics to get a handle on object oriented programming and how it can be
used to make studying mathematical models easier and more interactive.

Things to Note:
=============

While eventually the plan is to package this into an executable that's able to be launched on all platforms without a hassle, from the standpoint of usefulness the reality is that
the application will probably find the most love when run from either command line or IDE and making modifications to the code and re-running.

Eventually the plan is to solve more than just ODEs by including DDEs and PDEs and have a much larger spread of models within the scope of the application. Animated plots are
in the works as well.

The application is licensed under the GNU GPLv2. As such it is copylefted and meant for free use, modification and re-distribution subject to the terms of the Free Software Foundation,
