# FizzPyX

Welcome to FizzPyX, a library for numerically solving various differential equations with different computational methods.
This library has basically become a sandbox for learning computational neuroscience and applying a biological context to
machine learning with TensorFlow.

## Project Lifecycle Roadmap
* [x] Begin knowledge quest about how to understand the way a big fat bundle of interconnected point neurons give rise
to intelligence and consciousness
* [x] Ragequit ┻━┻ ︵ヽ(`Д´)ﾉ︵﻿ ┻━┻
* [x] Let project sit and gently fester for a time at the back of mind while immersing self in the world of employment
