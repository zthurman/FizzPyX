# NeuroFizzMath

Welcome to NeuroFizzMath, a python library for numerically solving various differential equations.

## Intended functionality
* This library is meant to be used for generating solution arrays for differential equations
* The base of the project is NeuroFizzMath.py and the solutionGenerator method therein
* Valid model inputs at this time are: 
>-'VDP', for the Van Der Pol oscillator  
>-'LIF', for the Leaky Integrate and Fire neuron model  
>-'FN', for the Fitzhugh-Nagumo neuron model  
>-'ML', for the Morris-Lecar neuron model  
>-'IZ', for the Izhikevich neuron model  
>-'HR', for the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model  
>-'HH', for the Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model


## Known issues
Every effort will be made to keep the items on this list as few as possible with additional information regarding the issue status.
