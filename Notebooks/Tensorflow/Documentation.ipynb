    "With Tensorflow, formalize how to work with what's described at the end of <i>Techniques in Fractal Geometry</i> by Kenneth Falconer: \"there are certain circumstances when it is appropriate to seek solutions of a 'differential equation' defined on a set that is itself fractal, <b>for example when modelling conduction of</b> heat or <b>electricity through a highly porous material</b>.\"  \n",

    "#### Nonlinear Dynamics  \n",
    "* Right now this is basically the development notebook. If I get it something working here I'll port it over into its own notebook or Helper  \n",

    "#### SHM  \n",
    "* Simple harmonic motion in its various incarnations  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Neuron Models   \n",
    "* ODEs that model ion channel recovery variables and membrane potential of a single neuron  \n",

    "* ODEs that model ion channel recovery variables and membrane potential of coupled neurons    \n",

    "### Helper Functions:   \n",
    "---\n",
    "* Helper functions are used to make the notebook code less verbose, they will appear in Helper.py  \n",

    "### Requirements:    \n",
    "---\n",
    "* All of this stuff is built inside a Conda environment, I will do my best to keep requirements updated so that these notebooks are more or less portable across platforms and results displayed in the notebooks are reproducable \n",
